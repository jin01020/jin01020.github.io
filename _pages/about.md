Hi, I'm a PhD candidate at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en), wrapping up my doctoral journey in [Computer Vision Lab](http://cv.snu.ac.kr) under [Prof. Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/). My passion lies in generative models, particularly research that bridges mathematical theory and practical applications, essentially translating mathematical insights into solutions that matter. I'm excited to contribute to the growing world of generative AI.

Feel free to reach out at [jin0.choi at snu.ac.kr](mailto:jin0.choi@snu.ac.kr) for any inquiries or to chat about research!
