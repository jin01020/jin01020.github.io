Hi, I am a 1st year MSc student in [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html), majoring in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en). I am currently working in [Computer Vision Lab](http://cv.snu.ac.kr), under the supervision of [Prof. Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/). My research interests is in computer vision tasks, mainly image/video enhancement via neural network. Currently, I am also interested in building generative vision models.

My ambition is to develop visionary models that provide assistance to individuals in ways that are perceived as magical. If you have any inquiries or wish to connect for professional purposes, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at [hij1112 at snu.ac.kr](mailto:hij1112@snu.ac.kr). I welcome all correspondence and look forward to hear from you. Wish you a wonderful day!
